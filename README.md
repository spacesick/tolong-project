## Machine learning model

We create a deep neural network for classifying seven types of injuries that often happen in accidents.

### Dataset info

We collected our Dataset various wound type from kaggle. We got 431 wound type image data in total and there is the distribution.

- Abrasions: 85
- Bruises: 122
- Burns: 59
- Cuts: 50
- Ingrown Nails: 31
- Lacerations: 61
- Stab Wounds: 23

### Architecture

We use the technique of transfer learning by adding multiple layers of fully connected networks on top of an InceptionV3 model pre-trained on the imagenet dataset. We freeze all the layers in the pre-trained InceptionV3 except for the last 12. We saved our best performing model in .h5 format and its weights in a .ckpt file, which so far has reached a validation accuracy of 0.8315. The latest checkpoints can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JRxoLPASzwMdFGjUG7gDhSLfg6zoRx-t?usp=sharing). History of build/develop model before fix model can be found [here](https://github.com/dhuhaardha/Model_Capstone)
